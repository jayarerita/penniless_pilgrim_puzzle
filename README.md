## Rules
You start at the North West corder and need to get to the temple at the South East corner 5 blocks over and down. You have no money and need to be able to pay the tax at the temple.

### Tax Laws
🧭 North: Divine blessing - Tax ÷ 2
🏔️ South: Mountain toll - Tax × 2
🌅 East: Sunrise fee - Tax + 2
🌄 West: Sunset relief - Tax - 2
